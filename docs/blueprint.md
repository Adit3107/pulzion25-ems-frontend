## Style Guidelines:

- Dark near-black but gradient and live background with one color in combination (#111111) to provide a strong contrast for the vibrant elements.
- Gradient from deep blue (#00008B) to electric purple (#8A2BE2) for main elements and sections, giving a futuristic, AI-themed aesthetic.
- Secondary gradient from cyan (#00FFFF) to green (#00FF00) used for highlights and call-to-action buttons, adding an energetic touch.
- 'Orbitron', a modern sans-serif font, to reflect a technology-focused theme. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- 'Montserrat', a clean and readable sans-serif font, to ensure readability throughout the website. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Implement a sticky navigation bar at the top with the 'Pulzion' logo and links to sections.
- Utilize Framer Motion for page transitions and scroll-based animations, animating elements as they come into view.
